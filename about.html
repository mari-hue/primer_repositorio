            <h1>Mission</h1> 
            <p> hey need to return to their sport. 
            Sports build character, confidence and camaraderie. We want all young athletes
            in our community to have the opportunity to play for life.</p>
            <h1>Vision</h1 >
            <p> We are all athletes who have played sports for most of our lives.
            We started Support Young Athletes (SYA) because all of us have known teammates, 
            school friends or neighbors who have suffered a major illness or injury and struggled financially as a result.  
            We want to help young athletes in our community as they fight to recover.  The members of SYA want to help our 
            fellow athletes “Get Back in the Game.”</p>
            <br>
            <h1>General Information</h1 >
            <p> Support Young Athletes is a San Diego based charity for kids, run by kids.
            Each board member is an athlete age 11-18 who desires to help other young athletes struggling
            with a financial need due to a catastrophic illness or injury.
            It is our goal to help young athletes obtain the resources they need to return to their sport. 
            Sports build character, confidence and camaraderie. We want all young athletes
            in our community to have the opportunity to play for life</p>
